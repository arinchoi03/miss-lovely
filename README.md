# Questions for Functionality/Design

1. Will there always be 4 weekly specials most of the time? Would you want to be able to have more than 4 items as weekly specials & randomly display four? Or display all weekly specials but limit four per view? (via another carousel or infinte scroll)

2. When viewing this application on the phone, what are the menus that you absolutely want to show? (like the Cart/Search) Would you want to hide the menu entirely and enable the user to click a button to display the menu (popout menu from the side)?

3. When a user clicks on the search button, what should be the behavior? Should a search box popover the current view and mask the background? Should it grow into a search bar that user can type into?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
